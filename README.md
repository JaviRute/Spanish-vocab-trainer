# Spanish-vocab-trainer

Shows a Spanish expression from a list for you to translate into English

This includes all expressions from the AQA specification for GCSE Spanish, divided by 8 modules, which are subdivided into sections.

Start by choosing a Module and a section, then you will encounter a random expression to translate.

You can click on the 'Hint' button (or press the Left-Shift key from your keyboard), and you will see a count of how many right answers you have and how many expressions are contained in that section.

This app had a good reception from my GCSE students.
