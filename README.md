# Spanish-vocab-trainer

Shows a Spanish expression from a list for you to translate into English

This includes all expressions from the AQA specification for GCSE Spanish, divided by 8 modules, which are subdivided into sections.

Start by choosing a Module and a section, then you will encounter a random expression to translate.

You can click on the 'Hint' button (or press the Left-Shift key from your keyboard), which will show the first letter. If you click the 'Hint' button again you will see the first and last letter of the expression, plus the total number of characters and spaces contained. For example the expression 'Que pasa tio' would look like 'Q _ _         _ _ _ _          _ _o'.

You will also see a count of how many right answers you have and how many expressions are contained in that section.

This app had a good reception from my GCSE students.
